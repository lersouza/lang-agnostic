# TODO(tydiqa):
_DESCRIPTION = """\
TyDi QA is a question answering dataset covering 11 typologically diverse languages with 204K question-answer pairs.
The languages of TyDi QA are diverse with regard to their typology -- the set of linguistic features that each language
expresses -- such that we expect models performing well on this set to generalize across a large number of the languages
in the world. It contains language phenomena that would not be found in English-only corpora. To provide a realistic
information-seeking task and avoid priming effects, questions are written by people who want to know the answer, but
donâ€™t know the answer yet, (unlike SQuAD and its descendents) and the data is collected directly in each language without
the use of translation (unlike MLQA and XQuAD).

        Gold passage task (GoldP) for {lang} language(s): Given a passage that is guaranteed
        to contain the answer, predict the single contiguous span of characters that answers the
        question. This is more similar to existing reading comprehension datasets (as opposed to
        the information-seeking task outlined above).

        This task is constructed with two goals in mind: (1) more directly comparing with prior work
        and (2) providing a simplified way for researchers to use TyDi QA by providing compatibility
        with existing code for SQuAD 1.1, XQuAD, and MLQA. Toward these goals, the gold passage
        task differs from the primary task in several ways: only the gold answer passage is
        provided rather than the entire Wikipedia article; unanswerable questions have been
        discarded, similar to MLQA and XQuAD; we evaluate with the SQuAD 1.1 metrics like XQuAD;
        and Thai and Japanese are removed since the lack of whitespace breaks some tools.
